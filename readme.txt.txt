Extra features for your consideration:

Player respawns at beginning of level if they lose all their health

Enemies make use of navmesh to accurately track character. Enemies are placed on ground as an obstacle
	after falling. There are many enemies so it is easy to become overrun.

Combined platforming with old-school puzzle mechanic by adding maze.

Player wins by reaching final platform. A message telling the player they have won is displayed.

Extensive use of moving platforms as accessible platforms and obstacles

Traps can damage player (spikes, bear traps)

Thank you!
